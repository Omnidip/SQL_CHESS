# SQL_CHESS
Chess implemented is SQLite

To build this project on windows you require sqlite3.dll, sqlite3.def, and sqlite3.h which you can get at https://www.sqlite.org/download.html . Simply put them all in the root directory and run make. You can likely compile this fine on any system, but it has only been tested on windows.
